This folder contains data computed using the code in the other folders.

'surfs2000.csv' is the most complete census of totally geodesic surfaces, containing data on all surfaces with 0 > Delta >= -2000

'orientability.xlsx' has computed orientabilities for all surfaces 0 > Delta >= -1000, along with whether 3|Delta for comparison

'duplicates.xlsx' highlights surfaces which share identical normal coordinates, with odd cases in blue and even in green. Even cases are not always nearby their identical partners, e.g. surfaces with Delta = -130 and -203 have identical normal coordinates
List is for 0 > Delta >= -1000

'duplicates2000.txt' lists all duplicate normal coordinates for 0 > Delta >-2000
