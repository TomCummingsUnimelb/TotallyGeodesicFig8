# TotallyGeodesicFig8
This repository contains programs created for my masters thesis, along with data computed using these programs. The programs compute totally geodesic surfaces in the figure-eight knot complement. The files are split among three folders:

* python: This contains the original python implementation of the algorithm described in my thesis. It is slower, but can produce diagrams using matplotlib.
* nim: This contains the later implementation. It is faster, but only outputs csv files.
* data: This contains data computed about totally geodesic surfaces up to a certain complexity.

For more info, see the readme file in the relevant directory.
I'll add a link to my thesis here later, as most things in this repository won't make any sense without reference to it.
