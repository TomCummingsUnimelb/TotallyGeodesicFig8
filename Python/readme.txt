This folder contains the python code used to implement the algorithm presented in my thesis, among other things. You will need python installed to use it, along with matplotlib if you would like it to output diagrams.

Try running "python figureeight.py 1 0 -2 -show" from command line.

Also included is the old (slow) surface census code (census.py, figureeightorbit.py) and the code used to compute the orbits of hermitian matrices in M(2,F_4)
